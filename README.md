# Memes Against Technology

This application is still a work in progress!

A game application along the lines of "Apples to Apples," but with memes instead of common phrases & nouns. This application utilizes Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Mocha, Chai, and Sequelize. Memes are stored as links in databases and are pulled to and pushed from the player and judge pages using CRUD operations and polling.
